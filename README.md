## what is it?
just some weird code full of sneakers in collaboration with bazel and dagger 🏎

## instalation:

as mentioned, this project can be build with `bazel build system` and `dagger framework`, so it's essential to be sure that all of them are installed properly:

* Installing `bazel`: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.3.0/install.html
* Integrating `dagger` with `bazel build system`: https://github.com/google/dagger

after completing these steps, build & run project:

```
bazel build //:SneakersMain
./bazel-bin/SneakersMain
```
enjoy! 🦕💙
